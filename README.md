### Hi there 👋😀, Namaste!🙏

I'm an emerging software developer. I was born in Nepal.  I moved to the United States on January 12,  2017, to pursue my Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems. My passion and patience are driving me in journeys. My soul is passionate about software development and Technology.

- 😄 I believe in the room for learning and space for improvements. I follow the motto of Learning Today and Leading Tomorrow.
- 🌱 doing my internship as a full stack developer at [Algorizn](https://www.algorizin.com). I am using Javascript, HTML,CSS, Java, with MERN (MongoDB, Express Js, React, Node Js) stack.
- 🤔 Also interested in Cloud Architecture, and Machine Learning.
📫 you can reach me out through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bikram-rumba/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rumbikram1231)
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm a huge fan of music. However, I'm worst at singing and playing music☺️😁. I love hiking, and driving up to the mountains with some sorts of music.
